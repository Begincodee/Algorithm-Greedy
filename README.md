In this programm we use algorithm Greedy in order to reduce number inequality of modular addition.
Run file trail_add_modulo will have 2 file txt. File Trail.txt will be used in algorithm Greedy.
File Trail_sage.txt will be used in sagemath to obtain the inequalities of modular addition. 
Then we will store it in file Trail_ineq.txt.
Run file Reduce_inequality.cpp, we wil obtain file Trail_reduce_ineq.txt.
